    <h1>What is VALORANT?</h1><div class="spinner-border" role="status">
  <span class="sr-only"></span>
</div>
    <p>Valorant (stylized as <strong>VALORANT</strong>) is a free-to-play first-person hero shooter developed and published by Riot Games, for Windows.
    </p><br>
    <h2>Agents</h2><div class="spinner-border" role="status">
  <span class="sr-only"></span>
</div>
    <p>There are a large variety of playable agents available in the game. Agents are divided into 4 roles: 
		Duelists, Sentinels, Initiators, and Controllers. Each agent has a different
		role which indicates how the agent is usually played.
    </p><br>
    <h3>Initiators</h3><div class="spinner-border" role="status">
  <span class="sr-only"></span>
</div>
    <p>Initiators plan out the offensive pushes. Initiators specialize in breaking through defensive enemy positions. Initiators' abilities can consist
		of flashes but also abilities that can reveal the location of enemies. This information allows for attackers to know where enemies are and make taking a site easier.
		Initiators include Breach, KAY/O, Skye, and Sova.    
 </p><br>
    <h3>Controllers</h3><div class="spinner-border" role="status">
  <span class="sr-only"></span>
</div>
    <p>Controllers specialize in "slicing up dangerous territory to set their team up for success."
		They use their abilities to create coverage or clear out areas of space with crowd control.
		Controllers include Astra, Brimstone, Omen, and Viper.
  </p><br>
    <h3>Sentinels</h3><div class="spinner-border" role="status">
  <span class="sr-only"></span>
</div>
    <p>Sentinels are the defensive line, which specializes in locking down sites and protecting teammates from enemies. 
		Their abilities mainly consist of static 'objects' that are obstacles to the enemies. These objects can give the team valuable information and/or deal damage. 
		Sentinels include Chamber, Cypher, Killjoy, and Sage.
  </p><br>
     <h3>Duelists</h3><div class="spinner-border" role="status">
  <span class="sr-only"></span>
</div>
    <p>Duelists specialize in attacking and entering a bomb site for the team. Riot's official definition for duelists is "self-sufficient fraggers."
		 Duelists include Jett, Neon, Phoenix, Raze, Reyna, and Yoru.
